## accuracyAssess
Simple python script for accuracy assessment based on confusion matrix.
This will assist in reporting the accuracy of map making. 
Note: The script is under modification for better usabality keep track of README.md/.txt file.

## Example error matrix
create comma seperated file (csv)
First Line
pixels for each class
Second line onwards
error matrix classes

-- Example usage
accessAccuracy.py errorMatrix.txt

-- Dependency
NumPy

Note: 1. For more information one sample error matrix file named 'errorMatrix.txt' is added to this folder.
2. To obtain error matrix visit tutorials at 'https://github.com/beeoda/tutorials'
3. In perticular refer to tutorial 4 Estimation 'https://github.com/beeoda/tutorials/blob/master/4_Estimation/4_estimation.pdf' and 'https://github.com/beeoda/tutorials/blob/master/4_Estimation/S4_methods_estimation.pdf'
